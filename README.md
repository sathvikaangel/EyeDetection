# Eye Cursor Control with Voice Detection

Welcome to the Eye Cursor Control with Voice Detection project! This repository contains the code and resources necessary to build a system that allows you to move the cursor on your computer screen using eye movements and also includes voice detection capabilities. This project aims to provide an alternative input method for individuals with motor disabilities or those who prefer a hands-free interaction with their computers.

## Features

1. **Eye Cursor Control**: The project utilizes eye-tracking technology to track the movement of the user's eyes and translate those movements into cursor movements on the screen. This allows users to control the cursor simply by looking at different areas of the screen.

2. **Voice Detection**: In addition to eye-tracking, the project also includes voice detection capabilities. Users can perform voice commands to trigger specific actions, such as clicking, scrolling, or opening applications. This feature adds an extra layer of control and convenience to the system.

3. **Customization**: The project offers flexibility in terms of customization. Users can adjust the sensitivity of the eye tracking, set up personalized voice commands, and fine-tune various parameters to suit their preferences and needs.

4. **Open Source**: This repository is open source, which means that you have the freedom to modify and extend the code to meet your specific requirements. Feel free to contribute, report issues, or suggest improvements.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, please follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/sathvikaangel/eye-cursor-voice-control.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up Eye Tracking**: You will need to connect a compatible eye-tracking device to your computer. Follow the manufacturer's instructions to install any required drivers or software.

4. **Configure Voice Detection**: The project uses a voice recognition library. Follow the instructions in the documentation to set up the library and configure it according to your preferences.

5. **Run the Application**: Once the dependencies are installed and the eye-tracking device is set up, you can launch the application by running the main script:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

6. **Calibration**: The first time you run the application, a calibration process will begin. Follow the on-screen instructions to calibrate the eye-tracking system. This step is crucial for accurate cursor control.

7. **Enjoy**: Congratulations! You can now move the cursor using your eye movements and trigger actions using voice commands. Experiment with the settings and voice commands to enhance your experience.
